Someone requested that the password be reset for the following account:
 
http://localhost/wordpress/
 
Username: admin
 
If this was a mistake, just ignore this email and nothing will happen.
 
To reset your password, visit the following address:
 
http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php?action=rp&key=AceiMFmkMR4fsmwxIZtZ&login=admin
 
-------------------------------
 
 
As we can see, fields Return-Path, From, and Message-ID, all have the attacker's
domain set.
 
 
The verification of the headers can be performed by replacing /usr/sbin/sendmail with a 
bash script of:
 
#!/bin/bash<br>
cat > /tmp/outgoing-email
